<h1 align=center>Description of the program: <font color=Blue>zeroth
</font>
</h1>
<hr>
This program makes a <a href="../chaospaper/node18.html">zeroth order</a> 
ansatz and estimates the one step
prediction error of the model. This is done by searching for all neighbors
of the point to be forecasted and taking as its image the average of 
the images of the neighbors. The given
forecast error is normalized to the variance of the data.

<h2 align=center>Usage:</h2>
<center>
<font color=Red>zeroth [Options]</font>
<p>
Everything not being a valid option will be interpreted as a potential datafile name. Given no datafile at all, means read stdin. Also <font color=Red>-</font> means stdin
<p>
Possible options are:

<h2 align=center>Description of the Output</h2>
The output consists of <font color=blue>s</font> lines, each of which
containing the steps forecasted (first column) and the relative
forecast error (second column). Relative means that the forecast error
is devided by the standard deviation of the data.

See also <a href="../wuppertal/predict.html">predict</a> which does essentially the
same but has some different options. The program <a
href="../dresden/mzeroth.html">mzeroth</a> can handle multivariate data, and 
<a
href="../dresden/xzero.html">xzero</a> does cross-predictions.
