eocn_prd_hss.scr is for EOCN
      in scr file:
      last_yr=(end year)
      longtime= (how many years)
      ntprd= (how many years are predicted)
      season (for MJJ)
      kp=? (to have k.le.kp,at the same time, need to change max_ac and min_rms in opt_k subroutine)

gocn_prd_hss.v1.scr is for GOCN(k=10)
      the same as above but nothing need to be changed in f file
gocn_prd_hss.v2.scr is for GOCN(k=opt)
      the same as above but means k.le.kp and need to change max_ac and min_rms in opt_k subroutine)

sequence_short-out.norm.scr and sequence_short-out.non-norm.scr 
are for puting normalized prd and non-norm prd since JFM1995 in the oder of time. 
sequence_short-out.obs.scr is for wmoobs
parameters need to be changed are 
nyear
model

hss_t_s.all_season.scr is for HSS with data from sequence_short-out.norm.scr

acc_rms_t_s.all_season.scr is for ACC&rms with data from sequence_short-out.non-norm.scr

CD102_2_2x2.scr is for from cd to 2x2 grid

for separating ENSO and no-ENSO years
1. pick_enso_year_data.scr
2. hss_t_s.all_season.selected.scr
3. CD102_2_2x2.scr

for anom fields of 2d and 1d:
anom_clim.scr

Testing time changing of OCN:
gocn.k_test.scr: just test K for different period with dependent data
gocn.k_test.jh.scr: repeat Huang and Huug's work
gocn.ltp_test.prog.noseason.scr: moving window, K not seasonally dependent
gocn.ltp_test.prog.scr: moving window, K is seasonally dependent, but not CD dependent
