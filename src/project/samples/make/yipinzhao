Peitao,

We are delighted that you and your family can come.

I was out yesterday and couldn't see your email. The directions are as
follows:

I495 --> I270, take exit 8 onto Shady Grove Rd. EAST, all the way, you
will pass thru several traffic lights and Route 355. Drive forward and
after passing by the exit to METRO (Shady Grove Station), you will cross
a small bridge over I370. At the third traffic light, make a right turn
onto TUPELO DR., about 200 m down the road, at the STOP sign, turn left
onto FOUNDER'S MILL DR., drive along a half circled path, the second
possible left turn is onto SUGAR MAPLE CT., our house is 7212 Sugar
Maple Ct. (on the right hand side).

Please call me if you are confused about this. Otherwise, I will see you
and your family around 5pm, Saturday.

Yiping
