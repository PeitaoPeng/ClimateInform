Zeng-Zhen,

Thanks for reminding.  The email slipped my mind.  I tried to use one ctl for the entire dataset.  
It is quite confusing. f00, f06, f12, and f18 each represents daily member from a specific
initial time (00z, 06z, 12z, and 18z)
TDEF represents the first target month. z represents lead month.  
z=1 is the first target month, z=2 is the second target month, ...

e represents initial date.  e=01 from the newest date and 41 is from the oldest date.  
e=01-10 are from the 10th backward to 1st within the first target month.  
e11 is from the last day of the month before the firrt target month.
For example, TDEF=April2019 means the forecast is for target months Apr2019 (z=1)
to Dec2019 (z=9) initialized from 10Apr2019 (e=1), 9Apr2019 (e=2), ..., 31Mar2019 (e=11), ..., 
1Mar2019 (e=41). Ensemble average of the forecast for May2019 from last ten days 
in March2019 is ave((f00(z=2)+f06(z=2)+f12(z=2)+f18(z=2))/4,e=11,e=20).

According to Qin Zhang: CFSv2 data in NMME dir have 32 members if issued in 6th of a month, with ICs in 6 days of curmon and two days in past month (8day x 4times/day)
